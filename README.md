**IN**tegration of millions of **S**ingle **C**ells using batch-aware **T**riplet networks

`INSCT` is a deep learning algorithm which calculates an integrated embedding for scRNA-seq data. With `INSCT`, you can:

* Integrate scRNA-seq datasets across batches with/without labels.
* Generate a low-dimensional representation of the scRNA-seq data.
* Integrate of millions of cells on personal computers.

## How does it work?

 1. `INSCT` learns a data representation, which integrates cells across batches. The goal of the network is to minimize the distance between Anchor and Positive while maximizing the distance between Anchor and Negative. Anchor and Positive pairs consist of transcriptionally similar cells from different batches. The Negative is a transcriptomically dissimilar cell sampled from the same batch as the Anchor.
 1. Principal components of three data points corresponding to Anchor, Positive and Negative are fed into three identical neural networks, which share weights. The triplet loss function is used to train the network weights and the two-dimensional embedding layer activations represent the integrated embedding.

To learn an integrated embedding that overcomes batch effects, `INSCT` samples triplets in a batch-aware manner:

## What does it do?

For example, we simulated scRNAseq data, where batch effects dominate the embedding:

However, `INSCT` learns an integrated embedding where cells cluster by group instead of batch:

## Installation

`INSCT` depends on the following Python packages. These need to be installed separately:
```
ivis==1.7.2
scanpy
hnswlib
```

To install `INSCT`, follow these instructions:

### Github

Install directly from Github using pip:

```alias
pip install git+https://github.com/lkmklsmn/insct.git
```

Download the package from Github and install it locally:

```alias
git clone http://github.com/lkmklsmn/insct
cd insct
pip install .
```

## Usage
### Unsupervised model
Triplets sampled based on transcriptional similarity
1. AnnData object with PCs
2. Batch vector

```alias
from insct.tnn import TNN
model = TNN()
model.fit(X = adata, batch_name='batch')
```

### Supervised model
Triplets sampled based on both transcriptional similarity and known labels
1. AnnData object with PCs
2. Batch vector
3. Celltype vector

```alias
model = TNN()
model.fit(X = adata, batch_name='batch', celltype_name='Celltypes')
```

### Semi-supervised model 
Triplets sampled based on both transcriptional similarity and known labels
1. AnnData object with PCs
2. Batch vector
3. Celltype vector
4. Masking vector (which labels to ignore)

```alias
model = TNN()
model.fit(X = adata, batch_name='batch', celltype_name='Celltypes', mask_batch= batch_name)
```

## Output
1. Coordinates for the integrated embedding
